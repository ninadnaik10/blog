Dear Friends,

As the COVID-19 has evolved into a pandemic, we are staying in our house to reduce the spread of the virus. I hope everyone is healthy and happy. We have plenty of time now-a-days so it is better to invest it in some work or task. We can get together with our family, start studying for next academic year, pursue any hobby, learn something new. If you have done all of these things and still want to do something else the best option would be reading your favourite authors' books. I have been reading some popular books. I read Chetan Bhagat's two popular novels namely, Revolution 2020 and One Indian Girl. I would like to post reviews of the books I have read. So, I am reviewing and giving my opinion about the book One Indian Girl. I will tell the story in brief in another blog so it would be easy for you to read the book.

One Indian Girl is a novel written by India's biggest-selling English-language novelist and columnist Chetan Bhagat. He published this book in 2016. The book consists of 272 pages.

The subject of the book is really important. In India and the other parts of the world, gender discrimination is a serious problem. People think that men are superior than women and only men can work outdoors. They can earn as many salaries as they want. In case of a woman, people feel inappropriate. This book explains that the right of working outdoor and earning a lot money is not only limited to men. This right is also deserved by the women. Every woman has right to marry at any age of her choice. They can and should achieve high success equivalent to men. Radhika Mehta, narrator of the story, did not let her achievements hide from anyone just to get married. Even though her sister got married at young age, she confidently denied many marriage proposals from her parents. She had decided to achieve her goals.

Author has distinctly separated each plot in the story which helps reader to understand easily. The language used is also simple and easy to understand. I felt the language used is little mature. There are some mature contents in the book so I cannot recommend this book for young children. Author has described some cities/countries namely, New York City, Goa, Hong Kong, Philippines, London very well. He has described the wedding of Indian culture pretty good. The book is a combination of drama, fun, happiness, grief. Readers will enjoy the story and won't get bored. I pretty much liked the book. I hope that even you will enjoy.

I will surely explain story in brief in another blog. If you have any suggestions or questions comment it below. I will answer your questions. Thanks a lot.
