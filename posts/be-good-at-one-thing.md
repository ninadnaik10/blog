Good afternoon everyone, let me ask you a question. Should you be a jack of all trades or a master of one? I am Ninad Naik and would like to tell you my personal experience. While I was in secondary school, I did exceptionally well in the quiz competition. Our house won first place for 5 consecutive years. As a result, I got a lot of opportunities to represent my school in city-wide quiz competitions.

Based on my experience, I recommend that you excel in one thing so that you are the best at it. In the next 3 years, you will learn numerous things, like web development, app development, AI, data science and many more. It’s good to have practical knowledge of all. But it’s important to do good in one single thing. That can be anything which excites you, makes you feel proud, and benefits you in the long run. For that you need to focus, be consistent, take challenges, give your 100% every single day and apply it in the real world. It feels great when you are committed to a single goal that influences your career, the work you will do, how much money you’d make and ultimately your own life.

Identify your interest, start working on it, take small steps, celebrate your failures and achievements. That’s when you will see the growth you need internally. Be serious in your life, dream big and never let the inner fire die.
